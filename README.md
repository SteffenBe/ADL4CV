# An intuitive natural language based image generation process

Student project for the course "Advanced Deep Learning for Computer Vision" at TUM.

The code is designed to be executed on Google Colab using the notebook [`ADL4CV_project_final.ipynb`](https://colab.research.google.com/github/SteffenBe/ADL4CV/blob/master/ADL4CV_project_final.ipynb).

Working versions of our models are included in the `trained-models` directory:
 * joint model (text encoder + image encoder)
 * GAN generator
 * GAN discriminator (useful to continue GAN training)
 * modifier
